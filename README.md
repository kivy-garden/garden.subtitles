Subtitles
=========


Display srt subtitles on top of kivy video Widgets.

SRT is not a very well defined format, this implementation is quite simple,
supports starts and end timestamps for display, and joining multiple lines with
'\n'.

If multiple texts are to be displayed at the same time, they will be stacked on
each others in the BoxLayout.


You can adjust the rendering of the text by passing a different value to
`caption_cls`.

See module documentation for more information.
